00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.630
Speaker1:
Hello, Chicago.

2
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.650
If there is anyone out there.

3
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.030
Who still doubts that America is a place.

4
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.230
Where all things are possible, who still
wonders.

5
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.520
If the dream of our founders is alive in our
time?

6
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.810
Who still questions the power of our
democracy?

7
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.020
Tonight is your.

8
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.690
Answer. It's the answer told by lines that
stretched

9
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.770
around schools. And churches in numbers this
nation has never seen by people who.

10
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.230
Waited 3 hours and 4 hours, many for the
first time in their lives.

11
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.000
Because they believed that this time must be
different, that their voices could be that

12
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.790
difference. It's the answer spoken by young
and old, rich and poor, Democrat and

13
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.770
Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian,
Native American, gay, straight, disabled and

14
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.730
not disabled Americans who sent a message to
the world that we have never been just a

15
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.670
collection of individuals or a collection of
red states and blue states.

16
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.760
We are and always will be, the United States
of America.

17
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.930
It's the answer.

18
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:59.110
That led those who've been told for so long
by so many to be cynical and fearful and

19
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.830
doubtful about what we can achieve to put
their hands on the arc of history and bend it

20
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.680
once more toward the hope of a better day.

21
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.360
It's been a long time coming, but tonight,
because of what we did on this day.

22
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.140
In this election, at this defining moment.

23
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.570
Change has come to America.

24
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.030
A little bit earlier this evening, I received
an extraordinarily gracious call from Senator

25
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:47.790
McCain. Senator McCain fought long and hard
in this campaign, and

26
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.650
he's fought even longer and harder for the
country that he loves.

27
00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.000
He has endured sacrifices for America that
most of us cannot begin to imagine.

28
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.770
We are better off for the service rendered
by this brave and selfless leader.

29
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.140
I congratulate him.

30
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.640
I congratulate Governor Palin for all that
they've achieved.

31
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.880
And I look forward to working with them to
renew this nation's promise in the months

32
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.620
ahead. I want to thank my partner in this
journey.

33
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.580
A man who campaigned from his heart and spoke
for the men and women he grew up with on the

34
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.870
streets of Scranton and rode with on the
train home to Delaware.

35
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.440
The vice president elect of the United
States, Joe Biden.

36
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.880
And I would not be standing.

37
00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.520
Here tonight without the unyielding support
of my best friend.

38
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.740
For the last 16 years.

39
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.350
The rock of our family.

40
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.810
The love of my life.

41
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.570
The nation's next first lady.

42
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.160
Michelle Obama.

43
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.540
Sasha and Malia.

44
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.750
I love you both.

45
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.000
More than you can imagine.

46
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.240
And you have earned the new puppy.

47
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.250
That's coming with us to the White House.

48
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.380
And while she's no longer with us, I know my
grandmother is watching.

49
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.250
Along with the family that made me who I am.

50
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.620
I miss them tonight.

51
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.550
I know that my debt to them is beyond
measure.

52
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.520
To my sister Maya, my sister Alma, all my
other brothers and sisters.

53
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.250
Thank you so much for all the support that
you've given me.

54
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.900
I am grateful to them.

55
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.360
To my campaign manager, David Plouffe.

56
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.590
The unsung hero.

57
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.350
Of this campaign who built the best.

58
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.810
The best political campaign.

59
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.900
I think, in the history of the United States
of America.

60
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.310
To my. Chief strategist.

61
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.630
David Axelrod.

62
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.770
He's been a partner with.

63
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.970
Me every step.

64
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.850
Of the way to the best campaign team ever
assembled in the history of politics.

65
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.850
You made this happen, and I am forever
grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it

66
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.650
done. But above all.

67
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.180
I will never forget who this victory truly
belongs to.

68
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.760
It belongs to you.

69
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.480
It belongs to you.

70
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.360
I was never. The likeliest candidate for
this office.

71
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.930
We didn't start with much money or many
endorsements.

72
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.220
Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of
Washington.

73
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.550
It began in the backyards of Des Moines and
the living rooms of Concord and the front

74
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.050
porches of Charleston.

75
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.020
It was built by working men and women who
dug into what little savings they had to give

76
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.830
$5 of $10 and $20 to the cost.

77
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.230
It grew strength from the young people who
rejected the myth of their generation's

78
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:58.710
apathy. Who left their homes and their
families for jobs that offered little pay and

79
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:05.010
less sleep. It drew strength from the not so
young people who braved the bitter cold and

80
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.350
scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect
strangers.

81
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.080
And from the millions of Americans who
volunteered and organized and proved that

82
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.560
more than two. Centuries later, a government
of the people.

83
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.640
By the people and for the people has not
perished from the earth.

84
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.470
This is your victory.

85
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.760
Now, I know you didn't.

86
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.190
Do this just to win an election, and I know
you didn't do it for me.

87
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:42.670
You did it because you understand the
enormity of the task that lies ahead for even

88
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.990
as we celebrate tonight.

89
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.690
We know the challenges that tomorrow will
bring are the greatest of our lifetimes.

90
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:56.350
Two wars, a planet in peril, the worst
financial crisis in a century.

91
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:02.680
Even as we stand here tonight, we know there
are brave Americans waking up in the deserts

92
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:09.100
of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to
risk their lives for us, their mothers and

93
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.360
fathers who will lie awake after their
children fall asleep and wonder how they'll

94
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.470
make the mortgage or pay their doctor's
bills or save enough for their child's

95
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.610
college education.

96
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:25.530
There's new energy to harness, new jobs to
be created, new schools to build.

97
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.060
And threats to meet.

98
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.310
Alliances to repair.

99
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.980
The road ahead will be long.

100
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.830
Our climb will be steep.

101
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.150
We may not get there in one year or even in
one term.

102
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.570
But America, I have never been more hopeful.

103
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.030
Than I am tonight that we will get there.

104
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.720
I promise you, we as a people will get
there.

105
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.490
There will be setbacks and false starts.

106
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.070
There are many who won't agree with every
decision or policy I make as president, and

107
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.080
we know the government can't solve every
problem.

108
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.300
But I will always be honest with you about
the challenges we face.

109
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.050
I will listen to you, especially when we
disagree.

110
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:30.860
And above all, I will ask you to join in the
work of remaking this nation the only way

111
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.860
it's been done in America for 221 years.

112
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:39.260
Block by block, brick by brick, calloused
hand by calloused hand.

113
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:46.760
What began 21 months ago in the depths of
winter cannot end on this autumn night.

114
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.640
This victory alone is not the change we
seek.

115
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.820
It is only the chance for us to make that
change.

116
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.200
And that cannot happen if we go back to the
way things were.

117
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.540
It can happen without you.

118
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.730
Without a new spirit of service, a new
spirit of sacrifice.

119
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:13.820
So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism,
of responsibility, where each of us resolves

120
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.560
to pitch in and work harder and look after
not only ourselves, but each other.

121
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.390
Let us remember that if this financial
crisis taught us anything, it's that we

122
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.380
cannot have a thriving Wall Street while
Main Street suffers.

123
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:33.020
In this country, we rise or fall as one
nation, as one people.

124
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:39.710
Let's resist the temptation to fall back on
the same partisanship and pettiness and

125
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.650
immaturity that has poisoned our politics
for so long.

126
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.440
Let's remember that it was a man from this
state who first carried the banner of the

127
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.750
Republican Party to the White House, a party
founded on the values of self-reliance and

128
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.150
individual liberty and national unity.

129
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.910
Those are values that we all share.

130
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.230
And while the Democratic Party has won a
great victory tonight, we do so with a

131
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:09.020
measure of humility and determination to
heal the divides that have held back our

132
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:18.660
progress. As Lincoln said, to a

133
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.820
nation far more divided than ours.

134
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.000
We are not enemies, but friends.

135
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:29.730
Though passion may have strained, it must not
break our bonds of affection.

136
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.970
And to those Americans who who support I have
yet to earn.

137
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.340
I may not have won your vote tonight, but I
hear your voices.

138
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.110
I need your. Help.

139
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.080
And I will be your president, too.

140
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.510
And all those watching.

141
00:11:54.510 --> 00:12:00.150
Tonight from beyond our shores, from
parliaments and palaces to those who are

142
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.060
huddled around radios and the forgotten
corners of the world.

143
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.420
Our stories are singular, but our destiny is
shared.

144
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.600
And a new dawn of American leadership is at
hand.

145
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.900
To those.

146
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.530
To those who would tear the world down.

147
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.420
We will defeat you.

148
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.570
To those who seek peace and security, we
support you.

149
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:34.470
And to all those who have wondered if
America's beacon still burns as bright.

150
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.430
Tonight, we proved once more that the true
strength of our nation comes not from the

151
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.760
might of our arms or the scale of our
wealth, but from the enduring.

152
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:48.850
Power of our ideals, democracy, liberty,
opportunity, and unyielding hope.

153
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.530
That's the true genius of America that
America can change.

154
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.550
Our union can be perfected.

155
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.380
And what we've already achieved gives us
hope for what we can and must achieve

156
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:18.870
tomorrow. This election had many firsts and
many stories that will be told for

157
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:24.060
generations. But one that's on my mind
tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot

158
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.580
in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of
others who stood in line to make their voice

159
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.650
heard in this election, except for one
thing.

160
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.010
And Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.

161
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:43.560
She was born just a generation past slavery,
a time when there were no cars on the road or

162
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.640
planes in the sky.

163
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.610
When someone like her couldn't vote for two
reasons because she was a woman and because

164
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.720
of the color of her skin.

165
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:59.540
And tonight I think about all that she's
seen throughout her century in America, the

166
00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:05.480
heartache and the hope, the struggle and the
progress, the times we were told that we

167
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:11.450
can't. And the people who pressed on with
that American creed, yes, we can.

168
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.760
At a time when women's voices were silenced
and their hopes dismissed.

169
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:20.780
She lived to see them stand up and speak out
and reach for the ballot.

170
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.160
Yes, we can.

171
00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:29.180
When there was despair in the dustbowl and
depression across the land, she saw a nation

172
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:34.960
conquer fear itself with a new deal, new
jobs, a new sense of common purpose.

173
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.140
Yes, we can.

174
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:43.010
When the bombs fell on our harbor and
tyranny threatened the world, she was there

175
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.410
to witness a generation rise to greatness.

176
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.330
And a democracy was saved.

177
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.740
Yes, we can.

178
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:56.360
She was there for the buses in Montgomery,
the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma,

179
00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.010
and a preacher from Atlanta who told the
people that we shall overcome.

180
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.090
Yes, we can.

181
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.940
A man touched down on the moon.

182
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.820
A wall came down in Berlin.

183
00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.180
A world was connected by our own science and
imagination.

184
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:21.880
And this year, in this election, she touched
her finger to a screen and cast her vote.

185
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:28.840
Because after 106 years in America, through
the best of times and the darkest of hours,

186
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.510
she knows how America can change.

187
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.340
Yes, we can.

188
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.240
America, we have come so far.

189
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.000
We have seen so much.

190
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.190
But there's so much more to do.

191
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:49.780
So tonight, let us ask ourselves if our
children should live to see the next century.

192
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:56.890
If my daughters should be so lucky to live
as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will

193
00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.550
they see? What progress will we have made?

194
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.300
This is our chance to answer that call.

195
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.400
This is our moment.

196
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.880
This is our time to put our people back to
work and open doors of opportunity for our

197
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:18.400
kids to restore prosperity and promote the
cause of peace, to reclaim the American

198
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:23.440
dream, and reaffirm that fundamental truth
that out of many, we are one.

199
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:29.620
That while we breathe, we hope, and where we
are met with cynicism and doubt, and those

200
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:35.320
who tell us that we can't, we will respond
with that timeless creed that sums up the

201
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.640
spirit of a people.

202
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.020
Yes, we can.

203
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.930
Thank you. God bless you.

204
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.060
And may God bless the United States of
America.
